### Instructions To Test And Run Game

To test and build, run in terminal:  
```mvn clean```  
```mvn package```  
  
As the tests are running, several screens may pop up.  
If the Starting Menu pops up, make sure to click "Start Game" (this screen may pop up several times).  
If the Game Over Menu pops up, make sure to click "Exit Game" (this screen should only pop up once).  
If the Winning Menu pops up, you can safely ignore it.  
  
Now the JAR file, named ```Game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```, will be in the folder ```target```.  
To run the game, run in terminal:  
```java -jar target/Game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```  

### Instructions To Generate JavaDoc

When you run ```mvn package```, the JavaDoc will get generated automatically.

To view the JavaDoc, navigate to the file ```target/apidocs/index.html```  
Right-click the ```index.html``` file, navigate to Open In Browser, and open it.
